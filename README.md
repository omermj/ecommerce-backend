# Ecommerce API

Ecommerce API is a robust backend framework designed to power a feature-rich 
shopping website. Leveraging REST principles, developers can seamlessly 
implement an ecommerce solution with ease.

## ‚ú® User Flow and Features
- **Authentication:** Ecommerce backend utilizes JWT for secure user 
  authentication and authorization. Upon login, users are issued a token, 
  which must be included in request headers for protected routes.

- **Categories and Companies:** Products can be categorized and assigned to 
  specific companies (manufacturers), providing a structured organization for 
  the ecommerce platform.

- **Product Filters:** Dynamically filter products by category, company, price, 
  etc. through dynamic SQL queries and request parameters, enhancing the 
  flexibility of data retrieval.

- **Sorting:** Easily sort products using different mechanisms during server 
  requests, allowing for a customized browsing experience.

- **Search Functionality:** Quickly locate products by searching through titles,
  providing users with a convenient and efficient way to find what they're 
  looking for.

- **Shopping Cart:** Products can be added to the shopping cart, with the cart 
  data persisting in the database. User carts are retrievable through user 
  login, while guest user carts are managed using a cartId stored as a cookie.

- **Order Placement:** Seamlessly place orders using the cart items data, 
  facilitating a smooth and intuitive checkout process.
